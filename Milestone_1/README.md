-Project Overview

FitPulse is a health monitoring system that analyzes data from fitness devices (such as heart rate, step count, and sleep patterns) to detect health anomalies using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to identify unusual patterns that may indicate potential health risks at an early stage.

-Objectives

Monitor fitness device data in real-time or batch mode
Detect abnormal health patterns automatically
Provide an easy-to-use interface for analysis
Assist in early health risk awareness


-Dataset Description

The dataset contains time-series fitness data such as:

heart_rate
step_count
sleep_tracking
timestamp

-Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib 
Seaborn
